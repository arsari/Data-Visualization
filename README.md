## Purpose

Represent the creation of control structures and the application of best practices related to the organization, commenting, and indentation of the program code.

We use “while loop,” If else statements,” and “for loops” to assure a better performance of the program code and provided a simple-controlled way to manage the user inputs. We use the import of OS module to provide a clean screen for the print of the program outputs.

We combine the use of list and functions to simplified the coding procedures and created blocks of code to explicitly represent the coding execution
